## Introduction

For my replication project, I have decided to replicate Study 1 of Canning et al. (2022). Canning et al. (2022, Study 1) examined the effect of perceived faculty mindset – whether they are perceived to endorse the view that intelligence is fixed or malleable – on student’s anticipated belonging and performance in a hypothetical college calculus class. Canning et al. (2022)  were specifically interested in the role of faculty mindset in producing gender disparities in belonging and performance in STEM. Canning et al. (2022) manipulated the perceived mindset by having participants read a course syllabus. After reading the syllabus, participants completed a manipulation check on perceived professor mindset (adapted from Dweck, 1999). They then completed the main outcome measures on perceived stereotype endorsement, anticipated belonging (Murphy & Zirkel, 2015), and then math test performance. The math test performance was 30 GRE problems used in prior research (from Schmader, 2002). 

For my replication project, I am specifically interested in replicating the anticipated belonging finding (i.e., Condition x Gender interaction). This finding is the closest to my own research interests on how institutional norms, practices, and policies influence students’ sense of belonging. Given time and resource constraints, I have decided not to replicate the performance finding. I will also adopt the study in several ways to be run on Prolific. The original study was conducted using a university subject pool (N = 217). With permission from the teaching team, I have decided to make the following adaptations. One, I will remove the single mention of mention of  “Indiana University honor code” on the stimulus materials, changing it to “the university honor code.” I can also recruit current or recent college students using the filters provided on Prolific, which I have successfully done before as part of my FYP. I will also try to recruit a relatively even balance of men and women to examine the gender effects.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

The original effect size for the finding I am interested in replicating was the result of
the Gender x Condition interaction on anticipated belonging (partial eta squared = .049).  

For 80% power - I would need N = 158 (153 denominator df + 5 parameters estimated)
```{r}
# Load appropriate packages
library(pwr)

# Power test
pwr.f2.test(u = 1, # numerator df
            f2 = (.049/(1-.049)), # effect size converted from partial eta squared
            sig.level = 0.05, # significance level
            power = 0.8) # Power
```
For 90% power - would need N = 209 (204 denominator df + 5 parameters estimated)
```{r}
# Load appropriate packages
library(pwr)

# Power test
pwr.f2.test(u = 1, # numerator df
            f2 = (.049/(1-.049)), # effect size converted from partial eta squared
            sig.level = 0.05, # significance level
            power = 0.90) # Power
```
For 95% power - would need N = 258 (253 denominator df + 5 parameters estimated)
```{r}
# Load appropriate packages
library(pwr)

# Power test
pwr.f2.test(u = 1, # numerator df
            f2 = (.049/(1-.049)), # effect size converted from Cohen's D
            sig.level = 0.05, # significance level
            power = 0.95) # Power
```

### Planned Sample

Based on the power analysis with 80% power, plus allowing for some data exclusions, I will
plan to recruit 180 participants. To be eligible for this study, participants must be at 
least 18 years of age, and either a current or former college student. I will utilize the 
"education" filters on Prolific to ensure that all participants are enrolled in college or
have recently received a college degree. I will set the upper age limit at 25 years old to 
ensure that participants are recent college graduates. This practice is consistent with 
past research that I have done. 

### Materials

As with the original study (Canning et al., 2022, Study 1) participants were exposed
to a course syllabus that was designed to imply that the professor had either a fixed or
a growth mindset of intelligence. Note that, per Canning et al. (2022), these materials were created
through focus groups with college students. Minor changes were made to these materials to 
adapt them for an online study. For example, I removed the one reference to "Indiana University". 

The complete outcome measures are below, taken from the Supplemental Materials:


Manipulation Check: 

Perceived faculty fixed mindset.
(1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree)

The professor in this class seems to believe that students have a certain amount of intelligence,
and they really can’t do much to change it. 

The professor in this class seems to believe that students either “have it” or they don’t. 

The professor in this class seems to believe that every student can learn new things and 
significantly grow their intelligence. 

The professor in this class seems to believe that some students are smart, while others are not. 

The professor in this class seems to believe that students who are less smart will always be less 
smart than the other students in the class.


Perceived stereotype endorsement
(1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree)

I think the professor in this class would endorse gender stereotypes. 

I think the professor in this class would treat male and female students differently in class.


Anticipated belonging [**Key Dependent Measure**]
(1 = Extremely, 6 = Not at all; all items were recoded so that higher values indicated greater 
anticipated belonging)

If you were a student in this class, how comfortable would you feel during this class? 

If you were a student in this class, how much would you feel that you could be yourself during this 
class? 

If you were a student in this class, how much would you feel that you “fit in” during this class? 

If you were a student in this class, how alienated would you feel during this class?


Personal mindset
(1 = strongly disagree, 6 = strongly agree)

You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you can’t really do much to change it.

Your basic intelligence is something about you that you can't change very much.

### Procedure	

As with Canning et al. (2022, Study 1) participants were recruited to take part in a study
on impressions of courses. However, as the replication study was conducted through Prolific,
and not a university subject pool, I made some slight modifications. First, participants were
told that we are a group of Stanford psychology researchers working with the math department
of a local community college to evaluate a new calculus course. After viewing the syllabus, 
participants provided their perceptions/impressions of the course by completing a manipulation 
check on perceived professor mindset (adapted from Dweck, 1999), perceived stereotype endorsement, 
anticipated belonging (Murphy and Zirkel, 2015), and, as a covariate, participant's own mindset 
(i.e., personal fixed vs. growth mindset). Canning et al. (2022) also had participants complete a 
math test (i.e., 30 GRE problems; Schmader, 2002). However, this replication project did not include
the math test due to time and resource constraints. 

### Analysis Plan

Canning et al. (2022) analyzed the key dependent variables by regressing the outcome on
gender (0 = male, 1 = female), condition (0 = fixed mindset syllabus, 1 = growth mindset
syllabus), the gender X condition interaction, and the personal fixed mindset covariate. 
They note that all participants were retained in the final analysis. If a participant has
missing data the researchers did not impute it and just excluded that participant from 
that outcome variable's analysis. 

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  As with Canning et al. (2022), I will regress
the key outcome variable (i.e., anticipated belonging) on Gender (0 = male, 1 = female), 
condition (0 = fixed mindset syllabus, 1 = growth mindset syllabus), the Condition x Gender
interaction, and the personal fixed mindset covariate. The key analysis of interest is the 
Condition x Gender interaction term for the anticipated belonging outcome measure. 

### Differences from Original Study

The major known difference between Canning et al. (2022, Study 1) and my replication study
are that the original study was run using a university subject pool by having participants
complete materials in-person. Thus, the participants were all college students. Likewise,
I will also recruit current (or recent) college students, but I will collect data online
through Prolific, rather than in person. This difference could influence the results of 
the replication. For example, it could be that participants are less likely to pay attention
online than in person. I have sought to mitigate this issue by using an attention check 
(i.e., "in your opinion should we use your data"), bolding key aspects of the stimuli, and
by adding timers to prevent participants from reading through the online stimulus material 
too quickly. However, in any study, whether in person or online, there is always a concern 
that participants will not engage seriously with the material. 

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

No changes were made to the methods before collecting data. 

#### Actual Sample
We recruited 193 workers on Prolific Academic who were in the U.S. and had at least a high 
school diploma and were between the ages of 18 and 25. Participants were compensated at
rate of $8.00/hour through Prolific. 22 participants were removed for one of the following 
reasons, as specified in the pre-registration: not specifying their gender (N = 5) or 
having a gender besides male or female (N = 9), answering no to the question on data
reliability (N = 5), and taking less than one second per question (N = 3). The final 
sample size was 171. Exclusions were distributed relatively evenly across conditions.

The final sample of 171 had a mean age of 22.27 (SD = 2), and had 74 participants who 
identified as male (43%) and 97 participants who identified as female (57%). The racial/ethnic 
breakdown of the sample is as follows: White (N = 77, 45%), Hispanic/Latinx (N = 19, 11%), 
Black/African American (N = 17, 10%), Asian/Asian American  (N = 30, 18%), Arab/Middle Eastern
(N = 1, <1%), and biracial or multiracial (N = 27, 16%). 87 participants were in the 
fixed professor condition, while 84 participants were in the growth professor condition.
92 participants met the criteria for first-generation (i.e., neither parent has a four-year 
college degree), with 87 were continuing generation. Of the 171 participants, 121 (71%)
participants are currently enrolled at a college or university, and 49 were recent 
graduates (29%; 1 participant did not answer). 


#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
We ended up recruiting a slightly larger number of participants than anticipated due
to an increase in funds, as participants took less time than expected.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

Confirmatory Analysis: Anticipated Belonging (controlling for personal mindset)
** This is the key analysis **
```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics (by cell)
df.data %>% 
  
  # group by condition and gender
  group_by(condition, gender_label) %>% 
  
  # summarize mean and sd
  summarise(mean = mean(belong_m, na.rm = T),
            sd = sd(belong_m, na.rm = T))

# Inferential statistics  (regress belonging on condition)
belonging_model = lm(belong_m ~ 1 + condition_c + gender_c + condition_c*gender_c +
                       personal_mindset_m, 
           data = df.data)

# Print summary of model
belonging_model %>% 
  summary()

# Calculate confidence intervals
belonging_model  %>% 
  
  # Add confidence intervals
  tidy(conf.int = T)

# Calculate partial eta squared
belonging_model %>% 
  eta_squared()
```

To replicate the main finding of anticipated belonging, we regressed the composite
score for belonging on condition (0 = fixed, 1 = condition), gender (0 = male, 1 = female),
and the condition x gender interaction, while controlling for participant's personal
mindset. The results revealed that contrary to the original study, the effect of mindset 
condition on anticipated belonging was not moderated by gender, b = 0.561, 
95% CI [-0.209, 1.332], F(1, 166) = 2.068, p = .152, partial eta squared = .01. As such, 
the key results did not replicate as predicted and preregistered.

### Exploratory analyses

Exploratory Analysis #1: Manipulation Check (controlling for personal mindset)
```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics (by cell)
df.data %>% 
  
  # group by condition 
  group_by(condition) %>% 
  
  # summarize mean and sd
  summarise(mean = mean(faculty_mindset_m, na.rm = T),
            sd = sd(faculty_mindset_m, na.rm = T))

# Inferential statistics  (regress faculty perceived mindset on condition)
facuty_model = lm(faculty_mindset_m ~ 1 + condition_c, 
           data = df.data)

# Print summary of model
facuty_model %>% 
  summary()

# Calculate confidence intervals
facuty_model  %>% 
  
  # Add confidence intervals
  tidy(conf.int = T)

# Calculate Cohen's D
cohens_d(faculty_mindset_m ~ condition_c, data = df.data)

```
Consistent with the original study, the manipulation check was successful, as participants expected the professor
to endorse more of a fixed mindset in the fixed mindset condition (M = 4.943, SD = 1.031) compared to the
growth mindset condition (M = 1.981, SD = 0.921), b = -2.962, 95% CI [-3.257, -0.266], F(1, 169) = 391.644, p < .001, 
Cohen's D = 3.03. This result is consistent with the original study (Cohen's D = 3.31)

Exploratory Analysis #2: Perceived Stereotype Endorsement (controlling for personal mindset)
```{r}
# Descriptive Statistics (by cell)
df.data %>% 
  
  # group by condition and gender
  group_by(condition, gender_label) %>% 
  
  # summarize mean and sd
  summarise(mean = mean(stereo_endorse_m, na.rm = T),
            sd = sd(stereo_endorse_m, na.rm = T))

# Inferential statistics  (regress sterotype endorsement on condition, gender, condition x gender interaction, controlling for personal mindset
stereotype_model = lm(stereo_endorse_m ~ 1 + condition_c + gender_c + condition_c * gender_c + personal_mindset_m, 
           data = df.data)

# Print summary of model
stereotype_model %>% 
  summary()

# Calculate confidence intervals
stereotype_model  %>% 
  
  # Add confidence intervals
  tidy(conf.int = T)

# Calculate partial eta squared
stereotype_model %>% 
  eta_squared()
```
Consistent with the original study, participants expected the professor to be higher in
gender stereotypes in the fixed mindset condition (M = 4.05, SD = 1.42) than the growth
mindset condition (M = 2.04), b = -1.320, 95% CI [-1.908, -0.732], F(1, 166) = 19.634, 
p < .001, partial eta squared = 0.40. Women (M = 3.25, SD = 1.73) were also more likely
than men (M = 2.81, SD = 1.48) to believe that the professor endorsed gender stereotypes,
b = 1.005, 95% CI [0.457, 1.553], F(1, 166) = 13.090, p < .001, partial eta squared = 0.03.
Unlike the original study (p = .054) this relationship between condition and gender was 
significantly moderated by gender, b = -1.182, 95% CI [-1.967, -0.397], F(1, 166) = 8.838, 
p = .003, partial eta squared = .05. 

Exploratory Analysis #3: Re-do anticipated belonging analysis with only current college students
```{r}
# Create dataframe with only current college students
df.data.current = df.data %>% 
  filter(current_student == 1)

# Regress belonging on condition, gender, condition x gender interaction while contolling for personal mindset
belonging_model_current = lm(belong_m ~ 1 + condition_c + gender_c + condition_c*gender_c + personal_mindset_m,
   data = df.data.current) 

# Print summary of model
belonging_model_current %>% 
  summary()

# Calculate confidence intervals
belonging_model_current  %>% 
  
  # Add confidence intervals
  tidy(conf.int = T)

# Calculate partial eta squared
belonging_model_current %>% 
  eta_squared()
```
When the anticipated belonging analysis is re-done with only the subset of participants that identified as current college students (N = 121),
the Condition x Gender interaction is still not significant, b = 0.314, 95% CI [-0.648, 1.275], F(1, 166) = 0.417, p = .520, partial eta squared <.001. 

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

This project aimed to replicate a key finding from Study 1 of Canning et al. (2022), that anticipated belonging would be overall lower in the fixed mindset than
in the growth mindset professor condition, but that women, relative to men, would benefit more from being in the growth mindset professor condition. In other
words, we sought to replicate the Condition x Gender interaction effect on anticipated belonging. The results from the confirmatory analysis did not 
replicate the original study's finding. The relationship between condition (fixed vs. growth) and anticipated belonging was not moderated
by gender. Instead, the results reveal that, both men (M = 3.78, SD = 1.41) and women (M = 3.85, SD = 1.41) had similar anticipated belonging in the growth mindset
condition. Analysis of simple effects revealed that the marginally significant gap in anticipated belonging that existed between men (M = 2.74, SD = 1.18) and 
women (M = 2.31, SD = 1.13) in the fixed mindset condition [b = -0.473, F(1, 166) = 2.976, p = .085] was no longer present in the growth mindset condition, 
[b = 0.089, F(1, 166) = 0.105, p = .746]. It should also be noted that the effect size of the replication for the Condition x Gender interaction 
(partial eta squared = .01) was much smaller than the effect size observed in the original study (partial eta squared = .049). To summarize, the key finding of interest did not replicate. 


### Commentary

When considering the exploratory findings, the majority of the results from the original study did replicate, indicating that, overall, replicating the study was a useful endeavor.
However, the key analysis of anticipated belonging did not replicate. Given the findings from the exploratory analyses, which are conceptually consistent
with the theory and findings from Canning et al. (2022, Study 1), there is always the chance that another replication study would have found a 
statistically significant effect, particularly if it employed a larger sample or used all college students from the same university. 

There are several reasons why we may not have replicated the original finding. First, it is always possible that the original study team's effect was due
to luck, and thus the original effect size was inflated. Second, due to budgetary constraints, my sample size (N = 171) was lower than the original sample size
(N = 217). However, it should be noted that the power analysis from above suggests that only 158 participants are needed for an effect size of partial eta
squared = .049 with 80% power. However, it is quite likely that the original study's effect size was inflated, which is further complicated by the
difficulties in having adequate power to detect statistically significant interactions. 

My study also utilized an online sample of Prolific workers, rather than actual college students. This change in sample characteristics could alter the
results in several ways. For example, all participants from the original study were college students currently enrolled at Indiana University. It could
be that specific cultural aspects of Indiana University could have affected the original results. For example, the STEM culture at Indiana may have norms 
that are particularly negative or harmful for women. As such, it is possible that the growth mindset professor was particularly effective in that context. 
Several recent studies show that numerous characteristics, such as peer norms (Yeager et al., 2019) or teacher's mindset (Yeager et al., 2022) can moderate 
the effectiveness of growth mindset studies (see also Walton & Yeager, 2020 for a discussion of context heterogeneity). To the contrary, my study utilized 
college students from all over the country, which would have added a source of heterogeneity that is difficult to account for. Given that it was an
online sample, it is always possible that participants paid less attention to the study materials. However, several changes, such as bolding key aspects 
of the stimuli, were used to account for this change. Furthermore, the manipulation check was significant with a rather large effect size (d = 3.03), which
indicates the overall success of the manipulation.
